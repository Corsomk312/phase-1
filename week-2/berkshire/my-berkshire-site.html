- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

	Beacuse this site was very simple I found it to be a fairly straight forward process.  Of course, we didn't get into anything complicated like META tags, divs, or tables.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

	I think that I am still learning how to use the actuala semantics properly and need to do more in depth research into that aspect of HTML.  There is a natural desire to try to use semantics to format as opposed to using it as structure.  Although we avoided that trap I have much to learn about the semantic side.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

	With the exception of using s style attribute for our img tag, we just used plain HTML and let the chips fall where they may.  Our final product looked pretty much like the example on Canvas.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

	Well, it's not really designed to handle style and formatting, but I don't know if that is a "bad" thing.  What seems good about it is that it provides the internal structure of the site.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

	One of my habits is to immediately include a closing tag for any tags that require it so that I can avoid the mistake of leaving tags unclosed.  Aside from that, I am still working on memorizing the different tags.
