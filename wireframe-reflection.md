##What is a wireframe?

In simple terms a wireframe is basically a sketch of the major elements of your webpage.  It provides a quick way to visually layout the various elements of your design to give you an overview of what you are doing.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing helps you to organize your thoughts and ideas in a visual way, allowing you to see an impression of what your webpage will become.  You will be able to see the relationships between different elements and make broad design decisions before you commit to writing any code, which can save you a lot of time.  You can share your wireframe with clients and gather feedback early, again before the coding process begins.  It also makes it easier to code because you will have a visual representation of what you are trying to produce.  Knowing what you are trying to accomplish ahead of time can greatly streamline the coding process.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

At first it was a little daunting because I wasn't entirely sure where to start.  I wanted to put the wireframe down and have it be perfect from the get go.  Once I let go of that idea and instead decided to play around with different layouts, the process was actually fun.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

As I hinted at above, I played around with a couple of different ideas, giving myself space in between drafts to put the work down, out of sight.  When I would come back to it, I would easily find elements that I wanted to change or adjust slightly.  I'd say there were probably three main iterations before I arrived at what I wanted.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I wanted to research other sites and really look at how they were layed out.  I looked at websites that were praised by certain critics for their effective use of layout and design.  It was an inspirational search; in the end, I took the best of the ideas that I thought would work well for me and my intentions, rather than copy anyone else's ideas.  I am still researching how to translate my knowledge of HTML into the design form I came up with.

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I wouldn't say it was tedious, but I did quite a bit of reading surrounding the principles of good layout and design, and that can get a little dry at times.  The actual process of wireframing itself was very engaging and I enjoyed that thoroughly.
